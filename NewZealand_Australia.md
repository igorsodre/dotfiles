## Final Tips

* **Bookings:** Hobbiton tours fill quickly—reserve early (\~10 months ahead) ([Hobbiton Tours][13]).
* **Guided vs unguided:**

  * Australia: Most hikes independent; Kanangra or complex terrains may need guide.
  * NZ: Tongariro crossing could benefit from guide due to weather. Hobbiton tour is fully guided.
* **Pricing estimates:**

  * Australia lodging from \~AUD 60 (hostel) to \~AUD 250 (mid-range hotel).
  * NZ lodging \~NZD 60–250 similar range.
  * Cars vary by vehicle and length—comparisons encouraged.
